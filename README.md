Arduino project

===========

Hello! This is my first commit onto github. This project was extremely fun to create because of all the testing
and troubleshooting that took place. 

This project uses the Arduino UNO microcontroller as well as a Parallax BOE-bot Shield and Chassis to create a mobile robot 
that avoids collisions using Infrared Sensor Data. 

To use, just download the Arduino program, compile this project, and upload onto the board.
